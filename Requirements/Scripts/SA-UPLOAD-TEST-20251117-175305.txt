If this triggers a webhook notification but user-uploaded files don't,
then we've found the issue: Google only sends notifications for changes
made BY the authenticated account, not FOR files it has access to.

This would mean we need to use a different approach:
- Option 1: Use OAuth with user credentials instead of service account
- Option 2: Use polling instead of push notifications
- Option 3: Have users upload via an API that uses the service account
